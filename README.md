## Code Test Python:

### This project is to demonstrate to sort the JSON file using Python
 #### Steps:
 1. Run codetest.py
 2. Using code_test.json file as an input to the python script, I have sorted the logs into separate files using event name and dates for chronological order
 3. Commands to run:
       ```python codetest.py```  
 4. The above command group records that share the same eventName and sort them in reverse chronological order, newest to oldest into a new JSON files ```jsonfiles```.
